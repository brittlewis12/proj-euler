# [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/about)

### Register & Setup
* If you [register](http://projecteuler.net/register) you'll be able to submit answers to check if they are correct.
* Create a new repo on Github called `project-euler`. You want this repo to be public. It shows people that you are intellectually curious and like solving challenging problems.
* You should create a problem1 file in this repo and start tackling problem 1.

### [Project Euler Problem 1](http://projecteuler.net/problem=1)
* Solve it either using Ruby or JavaScript (your choice)

```
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
```

### Bonus
* Refactor your code so that you can dynamically enter the max value and the two multiples you want so we aren't hard coded into using 1000, 3 and 5
* Solve it with both Ruby and JavaScript
* Refactor your code so that it is computationally more efficient (can you do it without loops??)
